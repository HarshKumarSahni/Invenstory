# Invenstory
Designed the frontend of an Automated Inventory Management System (AIMS) in Figma, enabling small businesses to manage stock efficiently, prevent under/overstocking, and improve operations.
We conducted surveys across various types of shops, ranging from small businesses to large enterprises, to understand their inventory management needs. Based on the insights gathered, we created user personas to analyze and refine the design of AIMS.

Our high-fidelity prototype, designed in Figma, reflects these findings and optimizations:
